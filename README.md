# tcp-experiments
A collection of small python scripts used for studying TCP/IP network behaviors.
Not very usefull, in fact.

There's an ICMP redirect example, used to redirect old OS IP stack to attacker machine, from phrack50, one to redirect Facebook's IP addresses and another from attacker choice. Tested and works even on switched network. The document `sucessfull_attack_information.txt` show the attack effect (currently only in brazilian portuguese, I'm lazy and will translate later).  Later I'll publish an IPv6 version of this attack.
